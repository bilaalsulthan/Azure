### Configuring On-premises Active Directory within Azure VMs

#### Step 1: Set Up the Virtual Machine
- Create a new virtual machine in the Azure portal.
- Choose the appropriate image (e.g., Windows Server) and ensure the VM size matches your Active Directory requirements.
- Configure networking settings to allow communication with your on-premises network.

#### Step 2: Install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Log into the VM and open **Server Manager**.
- Add the **Active Directory Domain Services** role.
- Promote the server to a domain controller, either creating a new domain or joining an existing one.

#### Step 3: Connect On-premises and Azure AD
- Set up a **VPN or Azure ExpressRoute** to connect your on-premises network to the Azure virtual network.
- Use **Azure AD Connect** to synchronize user identities and enable hybrid identity.
- Test the connectivity to ensure seamless integration.
